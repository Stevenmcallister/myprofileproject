			<p> My name is Steven McAllister, I am 29 years old. I warn born in Australia but am mixed-raced due to my parents.</p>
			<p> I am half Vietnamese and Australian, my mother migrated here during the Vietnam War and my father was born here with Irish/English heritage. </p>
			<p> I am returning to university to study IT after previously studying 2 separate degrees straight after highschool which I didn't complete. </p> 
			<p> I was studying Bachelor of Finance/Business straight out of high school and then moved to Creative Arts. </p>
			<p> I stopped both of these degrees because I didn’t find it interesting enough for me to continue a career in those fields of work. </p>
			<p> In my spare time I love to play cricket, have played it for most of my youth and am looking into getting back into playing for a local cricket club when the new season begins. </p>

				<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<p> I have been surrounded by computers from a young age.
My dad had purchased our first computer when I was about 5, and our internet was dial-up. It was amazing. I was fortunate to have elder brothers who were also interested in computers. I just fell in love with the sheer functionality of it. It wouldn’t matter if It was me using the computer, I was happy and content just to watch my brother use it or play games which of course was super annoying to them. The obsession continued when we built a new family computer together. Learning about each component that went into a computer and their purpose. How to take them apart and put them back together to work.

The Upgrade from our first computer to this new computer was mind-blowing. Worlds were no longer two-dimensional and pixelated, they started to become 3 Dimensional and realistic. Well at least back then we made ourselves believe they looked realistic. 
IT didn’t just stop at the world of gaming though for me, the internet was something that I think even till this day, doesn’t understand the impact that it has had on society. The ability to view what people are doing across the world through a snap, The social beginnings of the internet. (myspace, tumblr). 
There was always this passion towards computers and technology in general. But never thought of it being my career until I started working for a big corporate company and was fortunate to experience working with the Data science team working closely. The sheer power and ability that computers were able to manage all programmed by a team of people astounded me and really changed my life into wanting to go back to university to study it.

					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
